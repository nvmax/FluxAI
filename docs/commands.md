### Combining LoRAs
When using multiple LoRAs:

- Multiple LoRAs: Weights automatically balanced
- LoRA-specific prompts are automatically added from lora.json

### Resolution Guidelines
Larger resolutions take longer to generate:
- Select from a variety of resolutions defined in ratios.json
- Consider the intended use and how resolution will impact the final result
- Higher resolutions require more VRAM

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Prompt Writing**
   - Be specific in descriptions
   - Use artistic terms and detailed descriptions
   - Include desired style, lighting, and composition
   - For best results with /video, use highly descriptive prompts

2. **LoRA Selection**
   - Choose complementary styles
   - Test different combinations
   - Use /lorainfo to explore available options
   - Consider how LoRAs will interact with your prompt

3. **Resolution Choice**
   - Match to intended use
   - Consider generation time
   - Balance quality vs speed
   - Square resolutions (1024x1024) often work best for portraits
   - Landscape resolutions work well for scenery

4. **Customization**
   - Experiment with AI enhancement level
     - Scale from 1-10 with 1 preserving your original prompt and 10 being extremely creative
   - Adjust upscaling factor for higher resolution outputs
   - For /redux, try different strength values for each image
   - For /pulid, adjust strength to control how much of the reference image influences the result

5. **Rate Limits**
   - The bot has a limit of 50 requests per hour per user
   - Plan your generations accordingly
