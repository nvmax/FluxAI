## üîß Installation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ComfyUI Setup
1. Ensure ComfyUI is properly installed
2. Verify your installation directory structure:
   ```
   Example: 
   C:/Comfyui_windows_portable/ComfyUI/
   ```

3. Open Comfyui folder, open Update folder.
   - Run update_comfyui_and_python_dependencies.bat
   - Copy /setup/required files/For ComfyUI portable.bat.
    - run file, this will install Triton and Sage attention.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bot Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nvmax/FluxAI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file: 
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. **Run Setup Tool**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   The setup tool will:
   - Copy required files needed to run
   - Setup your .env file with variables specified
   - download all files from huggingface and place them in the required folders
   - install custom nodes needed for the bot to run generations
   


- depending on your setup you may need to edit the json files to select the version of dev flux you are using for pulid and redux. 
- you can open these in comfyui and change the checkpoint in the gui, then click workflow and export api and replace the redux.json and reduxprompt.json files with the new json files. !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORKFLOWS IN COMFYUI !!!
- manually editing them open the .json files and change the name of the unet_name to the name of the checkpoint you want to use, the checkpoint you use must be in the models/unet folder.

   - In redux.json find and change the name to your checkpoint name.
``` 
      "61": {
    "inputs": {
      "unet_name": "fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors",
      "weight_dtype": "fp8_e4m3fn"
    },
    "class_type": "UNETLoader"
  },
```  
   - in reduxprompt.json find and change the name to your checkpoint name.
```
 "12": {
    "inputs": {
      "unet_name": "fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors",
      "weight_dtype": "fp8_e4m3fn"
    },
    "class_type": "UNETLoader"
  },
```
- here are the names of the checkpoints for each version of Flux that can be used in the json files.
```
'FLUXFusion 6GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ3KM.gguf',

    'FLUXFusion 8GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ50.gguf',
        
    'FLUXFusion 10GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ6K.gguf',
        

    'FLUXFusion 12GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ80.gguf',

    'FLUXFusion 24GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors',

    'FLUX.1 Dev': 
        'filename': 'flux1-dev.safetensors',

    
```
- Please enter in the one you specified when you run the setup.py so your not constantly switching checkpoints and causing slow downs.

- I am working on automating this process so you don't have to do it manually.
